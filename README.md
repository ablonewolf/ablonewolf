:wave: Hi there, my name is Arka Bhuiyan.ðŸ˜€ I'm a self-taught Software Engineer and Cybersecurity enthusiast with profound knowledge in Java, Linux command line, JavaScript, Python, C++, Backend Technologies, Git, and Software Design Patterns.

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from the University of Dhaka, Bangladesh. My interests include researching Software Engineering, Cyber Security, Cryptography, Machine Learning, and Data-related problems.

I enjoy working with new technologies, exploring open-source tools, and diving into security-related topics.ðŸ¤–

I am currently a Software Engineer specializing in Full-stack Web Application Development at BRAC IT Services, with a focus on Back-end development. Before this, I worked as a Software Engineer at TechnoNext Limited and BJIT Limited, each for about a year, where I developed web applications.

I have gained solid industry experience in JavaEE and the Spring Framework, and I am proficient in JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, Responsive Web Design, and React.

In my free time, I enjoy type racing, watching blogs related to Linux and software development, and solving problems on LeetCode. I am passionate about continuous learning and have completed various online courses on Udemy and Coursera to broaden my technical skills. For me, enhancing my skill set and maintaining a steep learning curve is crucial.
